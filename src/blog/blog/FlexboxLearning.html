<h1> The Flexabiltiy in FlexBox</h1>
<h2>12/5/2022




</section>

<main> 
<p> Layouts can be tough. We need to get the aligment and distribution of space in container 
    sizes that vary. It causes some real headaches, but for every problem better alternatives are release. So when FlexBox was introuduced, this has allow developers more flexabiltiy when creating layouts. It also just gives developers quick ways to make
    simple layouts. 

    This blog post is a quick reference guide on how flexbox works and how we, as developers, can use it to make quick simple layouts. 
</p> 

<p> Note: FlexBox is great for simple layouts that are based on the x and y axises. Anything that requires  unique layouts or changing orientaations - Grid is a better option</p>


<p> When I started learning CSS, quickly was flexbox a topic that I needed to learn. As much of a learning curve Flexbox can have, the fundlements are simple. Here are a couple key pointers when using flexbox for your first time. </p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>FlexBox revoles around Parent element (flex container) and Child elements of that flex container.  </li>
    <li>The flow of Flexbox default is "row". So all child contaniers we be placed on the same x-axis, moving left to right </li>
    <li>Flexbox allows us to place items at the start, center, or end of the axis while allowing standard spacings for these items. </li>
</ol>
    

<p>1. FlexBox revoles around a parent element (flex container) and child elements (flex items) of that parent container.
Flexbox works when "Display: Flexbox;" is used on a parent container in our css. The parent container has a direct connection to the child 
thus when we adjust the proporties, we are moving the childern elements. The Parent container does not move. 
</p>

<div id="parent-container">
    <h5 class="container-text"> Parent Container</h5>
    <div class="child-container">
        <h5 class="container-text-child"> Child Container</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="child-container">
        <h5 class="container-text-child"> Child Container</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="child-container">
        <h5 class="container-text-child"> Child Container</h5>
    </div>
